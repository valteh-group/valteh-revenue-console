# Valteh Economics Dashboard

Internal economics, pricing, and business management dashboard for Valteh service lines:

- SAREMI document validation
- Graphos graph analytics
- Blockchain / BaaS property registry services
- SIGEN / Notarial Platform

The app tracks fixed costs, variable costs, usage, revenue, margins, pricing scenarios, and client-level profitability.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Dash
- Dash Bootstrap Components
- Plotly
- Pandas
- SQLAlchemy
- Pydantic
- SQLite locally, PostgreSQL-ready through `DATABASE_URL`
- Pytest
- Ruff and Black
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Install

```bash
cd Valteh_Revenue_App
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
copy .env.example .env
```

On macOS/Linux, activate with:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Run Locally

```bash
python -m app.main
```

or:

```bash
python app/main.py
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8050
```

## Run Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Format and Lint

```bash
black .
ruff check .
```

## Run With Docker

```bash
copy .env.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

## Deploy

For Render or similar hosts, use the repository root as the project directory.

```text
Build command: pip install -e .
Start command: gunicorn app.main:server
```

The app also supports `python -m app.main` and reads the host-provided `PORT` environment variable.

## Seed Data

The app reads the current pilot seed data from four CSV files:

- `data/seed_clients.csv`
- `data/seed_client_subscriptions.csv`
- `data/seed_costs.csv`
- `data/seed_usage.csv`
- `data/seed_pricing_plans.csv`

Pilot assumptions are based on:

- Queretaro RPP request data from `solicitudes_RPP.xlsx`, which shows roughly 25.5k monthly state-level requests in the 2023 extract.
- Notary document-validation logic of roughly 2 people per registry matter and 6-8 documents per person.
- Current SAREMI pilot infrastructure cost: Hetzner CX41 at about $370 MXN/month plus Claude document analysis at about $0.95 MXN/document.
- Future-state blockchain/BaaS cost ranges from `modelo economico.pdf`, included as `estimate` rows (excluded from actuals) because the current pilot is focused on SAREMI, some Graphos visualization, and lightweight blockchain audit anchoring.
- Subscription history lives in `seed_client_subscriptions.csv`, so each client can start, stop, or switch plans over time. Setup, annual, monthly fixed, and variable usage fees live only in `seed_pricing_plans.csv`.

### Maintain cost history

`data/seed_costs.csv` is the cost catalog used by the economic dashboard. It stores actual, budget, and
estimate cost records for fixed subscriptions, one-time purchases, and usage-based rates. Each row is one
version of a cost. The numeric `id` identifies that specific row, while `cost_key` is the stable business
identifier for the underlying cost concept across versions.

When a cost changes, do not edit the historical amount in place:

1. Set `end_date` on the current row to the day before the change.
2. Add a row with a new unique `id`, the same `cost_key`, the new `start_date`, quantity, and unit cost.
3. Leave `end_date` empty while the new version remains in force.

For manual CSV edits, `id` can be left blank; the loader will assign the CSV row number as the record id.
`cost_key` can also be left blank for simple new costs, and the loader will derive one from stable descriptive
fields. For historical versions of the same cost, keep an explicit shared `cost_key` so the app can treat the
rows as versions of one concept.

Use `quantity` and `unit_cost` separately (for example, 4 users x 8 USD). `record_type=actual` participates in reported costs;
`budget` and `estimate` remain visible but are excluded from actual margins. Set `end_date` when a cost
ceases to exist. `enabled` is an operational kill switch and accepts values such as `TRUE/FALSE` or `ON/OFF`;
it should not replace lifecycle dates.

Costs are reported in MXN. Seed rows can currently be entered in `MXN` or `USD`; USD rows are converted to MXN
with the temporary flat rate `1 USD = 18 MXN`. Later FX history can replace this static conversion in the
currency utility without changing ordinary seed rows.

Effective dates are resolved for each requested accounting month. A row is active when `enabled=TRUE`,
`start_date` is on or before the requested period, and `end_date` is blank or still covers that period.
Overlapping `actual` rows for the same `cost_key` are rejected so a versioned cost cannot be double-counted.

Microsoft subscription example:

```csv
id,cost_key,quantity,unit_cost,currency,start_date,end_date
2,software.microsoft365.team,4,6,USD,2026-05-01,2026-06-30
15,software.microsoft365.team,4,8,USD,2026-07-01,
```

With this history, May 2026 and June 2026 use `4 x 6 USD x 18 = 432 MXN`. July 2026 onward uses
`4 x 8 USD x 18 = 576 MXN`. Historical months stay unchanged because the old row is ended instead of overwritten.

To add users to a per-user subscription, end the old row and add a new row with the same `cost_key`, updated
`quantity`, and the date the new user count starts. To add a new fixed cost, use `cost_type=fixed`,
`charge_basis=flat` or `per_user`, `billing_frequency=monthly`, and the appropriate `service_line`,
`provider`, and `category`. To add a usage-based cost, use `cost_type=variable`, `charge_basis=usage`,
`billing_frequency=usage`, and set `unit` to the usage event type that should consume the rate.

Usage-based costs are mapped by `unit`: for example, a cost row with `unit=saremi.document_validation` applies
to usage events whose `event_type` is `saremi.document_validation`. The same event type can have multiple
cost components with different `cost_key` values, such as an external AI rate plus local preprocessing.

To disable or end a cost, prefer setting `end_date` when the cost lifecycle is known. Use `enabled=FALSE`
only when the row should be excluded operationally without changing its historical dates.

The CSV-backed app reads seed files at runtime. The schema initialization helper is idempotent and can be run
with:

```bash
python -c "from app.data.seed_data import seed_database; seed_database()"
```

Run tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

The repository layer in `app/data/repositories.py` exposes this data to the UI and domain logic. `app/data/database.py` and `app/data/schemas.py` define the SQLAlchemy foundation for moving from CSV-backed local data to SQLite or PostgreSQL persistence.

## Add a New Service Line

1. Add the service definition in `SeedRepository.services()` or the future `services` table.
2. Add usage event types to `data/seed_usage.csv`.
3. Add matching variable cost rates to `data/seed_costs.csv`.
4. Add pricing fields or event mapping in `app/domain/revenue_engine.py` if the service has billable units.
5. Add charts or tables in the relevant page module if the service needs custom display.

## Connect Holding APIs (Operational Events)

This console consumes operational events from the holding's source systems
(`baas-qro`, `rpp-fraud-detection-system`, future `sigen-plus-front`). Source
systems emit operational facts only; all pricing, cost, revenue, and margin
logic stays in this app. The full contract and architecture live in:

- `docs/shared-operational-event-contract.md`
- `docs/event-consumption-architecture.md`

### Pull pipeline (Phase 1: ingestion foundation)

Each source system exposes `GET /api/operational-events` (cursor-paginated).
This app pulls those pages and stores raw facts idempotently.

- `app/domain/operational_events.py` — Pydantic contract models.
- `app/integrations/operational_events_client.py` — HTTP client (`httpx`).
- `app/integrations/ingestion.py` — idempotent sync, dedup by
  `(source_system, source_event_id)`, cursor tracking.
- `app/integrations/sync_runner.py` — entry point.

Configure source URLs and tokens in `.env` (see `.env.example`), then run:

```bash
python -m app.integrations.sync_runner
```

Imported events land in `imported_operational_events`. Classification,
normalization to `UsageEvent`, and economic calculation are later phases
described in `docs/event-consumption-architecture.md`.

### Legacy placeholders

The earlier mock integration placeholders still live in `app/integrations/`
(`fetch_saremi_usage()`, `fetch_llm_token_usage()`, `fetch_graphos_usage()`,
`fetch_blockchain_usage()`, `fetch_platform_clients()`). They are superseded by
the pull pipeline above and kept only as references. Keep API authentication and
endpoints in `.env`, not in source code.

## Production Notes

Set `DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL SQLAlchemy URL, for example:

```text
postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@host:5432/valteh_economics
```

Keep business calculations in `app/domain/`. Dash callbacks and page modules should call domain functions and repositories rather than embedding pricing, cost, or margin logic directly in the UI.
